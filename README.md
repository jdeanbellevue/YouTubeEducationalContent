## Business Problem
The rapidly expanding digital age sees platforms like YouTube becoming primary sources of education and information. However, not all languages and cultures are equitably represented, potentially leaving vast audiences underserved. Identifying these gaps can uncover significant opportunities for content creators and educators, enhancing global knowledge dissemination.

## Data Explanation
The data analyzed consists of YouTube statistics segmented by country, detailing subscriber counts, video views, and educational channel presence, among other variables. To ensure accuracy, data underwent cleansing, addressing missing values and inconsistencies.

## Methods
I used descriptive analytics to understand the landscape and inferential statistics to draw conclusions. By comparing video consumption per capita with the presence of educational channels, I was able to identify countries, and by extension, languages potentially underserved by tailored educational content.

## Analysis
Countries like France, UAE, and Brazil, despite high YouTube usage, lacked proportionate educational channels. This disparity implies potential underserved audiences in French, Arabic, and Portuguese, among others, indicating gaps in quality, culturally relevant, or specialized content in these languages. Other countries such as South Korea also showed a lack of educational channels however there are known large alternatives to YouTube in their area.

## Conclusion
There exists a tangible gap in YouTube's educational content for specific languages and regions. Addressing this discrepancy can democratize knowledge access, offering culturally relevant education to global audiences, and unlocking untapped markets for content creators.

## Ethical Assessment
While the intention is to democratize access to educational content, care must be taken to respect cultural nuances. Avoiding cultural appropriation, ensuring accurate representation, and respecting privacy during data analysis are paramount to maintain ethical integrity.
